##### Abstract

The $^{25}$Al(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Si reaction is part of a reaction network with impact on the observed galactic $^{26}$Al abundance. A new determination of the proton strength of the lowest $\ell$= 0 proton resonance in $^{26}$Si is required to more precisely calculate the thermal reaction rate. To this end, the $^{25}$Al(d,n)$^{26}$Si proton-transfer reaction is measured in inverse kinematics using an in-flight radioactive beam at the RESOLUT facility. Excitation energies of the lowest $^{26}$Si proton resonances are measured and cross sections are determined for the lowest $\ell$= 0 resonance associated with the $3^+_3$ state at 5.92(2) MeV. Coupled reaction channels calculations using FRESCO are performed to extract the $\ell$= 0 spectroscopic factor for the $3^+_3$ state. The proton width for the $3^+_3$ state in $^{26}$Si is determined to be p = 2.19(45) eV and the (p,$\gamma$) resonance strength for the $3^+_3$ state is extracted as 0.026(10) eV. This resonance dominates the $^{25}$Al(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Si reaction rate above 0.2 GK.
